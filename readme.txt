Containts of the zip package:
1. python proj.ipynb
2. draft.py
3. projdb.sqlite
4. templates folder
5. readme.txt

Please open the python proj notebook first. From there, if no database is present, create the database by running the first cell. Next, run the register_client function, passing your desired id, name and password. Alternatively, you can use the existing database file. Here are some log in crudentials: login: 2, password: 123

Next, open the draft.py file and replace the path_var string with the path to your database. You can run the file now. The application should appear at 127.0.0.1:5000. The admin login is 'user', the password is 'pass' (only for the add cars function).

Note that absolute paths are recommended in the draft.py file. On the contrary, the python proj.ipynb file does seem to handle relative paths pretty well.
